Song Management System
This project is a desktop application built using Windows Presentation Foundation (WPF) and C#. It is a CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) system that is connected to a SQL Server database, allowing users to manage songs' details such as title, author, and release date.

Getting Started
To use this application, you must first download and install Microsoft SQL Server on your machine.

Once the database is set up, open the solution file in Visual Studio and run the application. You can then add, edit, or delete songs using the interface.
